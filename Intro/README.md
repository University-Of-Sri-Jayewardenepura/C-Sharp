# Introduction to C#



C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language
developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. The first version of
the C# compiler was released in June 2000 as a beta version.

**Evolution of C#**

In the early 2000s, C# went through several iterations:

* **C# 1.0 (2000)**: The initial release, which focused on building Windows
applications.
* **C# 1.1 (2003)**: Introduced support for generics, iterators, and partial
classes.
* **C# 2.0 (2005)**: Added features like anonymous methods, lambda
expressions, and partial methods.

**Xamarin's Impact (2004)**

In 2004, Microsoft released Xamarin, a new framework that allowed developers
to create cross-platform applications using C#. This marked a significant
milestone in the evolution of C#, as it opened up new possibilities for
building apps that could run on multiple platforms, including Windows,
Android, and iOS.

**Key Features of Early C#**

Some key features that were introduced in early versions of C# include:

* **Object-oriented programming**: C# is an object-oriented language that
supports concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and
encapsulation.
* **Multi-paradigm programming**: C# allows developers to write code using
different programming paradigms, such as procedural, functional, and
declarative styles.
* **Garbage collection**: C# uses a garbage collector to manage memory
allocation and deallocation, making it easier for developers to write robust
code.
* **Nullable types**: The language provides nullable types that guard
against variables that don't refer to allocated objects, helping prevent
null reference exceptions.
* **Exception handling**: C# provides a structured and extensible approach
to error detection and recovery through its exception handling mechanisms.
* **Lambda expressions**: C# introduced lambda expressions, which enable
developers to write concise and expressive code using anonymous functions.
* **Language Integrated Query (LINQ)**: LINQ allows developers to query data
structures using a SQL-like syntax, making it easier to manipulate and
retrieve data.

## C# Coding Structure

**Namespace and Assembly**

In C#, a **namespace** is a container for related classes. It's a collection
of classes that can be used throughout an application. A namespace helps
organize code by grouping related classes together.

An **assembly**, on the other hand, is a file automatically generated by the
compiler after successful compilation of every .NET application. Assemblies
can be either Dynamic Link Layer (DLL) or executable files (.exe). The
assembly gets updated only once for an application and upon each subsequent
compilation, it does not get recreated.

Here's a commented example code snippet in C# to illustrate these concepts:
```csharp
// Define a namespace called "MyNamespace"
namespace MyNamespace
{
    // Define a class called "Calculator" within the namespace
    public class Calculator
    {
        // Method to calculate the sum of two numbers
        public int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
```
This example defines a namespace `MyNamespace` with a class `Calculator`
that contains a method to calculate the sum of two numbers. The assembly for
this code would be generated as a DLL file.


**WHAT'S AN IDENTIFIER?**
=====================================

A name that we can assign for:

* A class, interface, struct, delegate or enum member
* A variable
* A namespace

An identifier is a series of characters consisting of:

* Unicode letter characters
* Decimal digit characters
* Unicode connecting characters
* Unicode combining characters
* Unicode formatting characters

**Characteristics:**

* Should start with a letter or underscore (-)
* Does not contain any spaces or symbols
* Case sensitive
* Should not be a C# keyword

**BEST PRACTICES IN C# NAMING CONVENTIONS**
==================================================

### Class, Struct, Method, Property, or Constant Field Naming

* Prefer Pascal casing for naming classes, structs, methods, properties, or constant fields.

### Interface Naming

* Typically prefix interfaces with a capital letter "I".
* Alternatively, use Pascal casing for interface names.

### Method Argument, Private Field, and Local Variable Naming

* Use camel case for naming method arguments, private fields, and local variables.
* Prefix private fields with an underscore (_) character.

### Naming Guidelines

* Always use meaningful and self-explanatory names for your classes, methods, and properties.

**KEYWORDS IN C#**
=====================

### Reserved Words

* Predefined words reserved by the C# compiler.
* Examples: `class`, `interface`, `namespace`, `public`, `private`
* Cannot be used as identifiers.

### Using Keywords as Identifiers

* If you want to use a keyword as an identifier, prefix it with the `@` character.

### Special Meaning in Code Context

* These keywords have a special meaning within the context of your code.
