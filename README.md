# C# used in Visual Application Programming

## Introduction 

- **Visual Application Programming**: Any programming language that allows the user to
specify a program in a Two- (or more)-dimensional way,.
by manipulating program elements graphically rather
than by specifying them textually.


- **Main goals of using Visual Programming Language**
    - Make programming more accessible to novices.
    - Support programmers at three different programming levels.
    - Component based programming.
    - Cater for rapid application development (RAD).

- **Basics in a Language**
    1. **Syntax**: the rules that defines the combinations of symbols, wordings
    and characters which is correctly structured for a particular language.
    2. **Semantics**: the study of literal meaning. Semantics can address
    meaning at the levels of words, phrases, sentences, or larger units of
    discourse.
    3. **Pragmatics**: the study of how context contributes to meaning.


## Component-Based vs. Object-Oriented Programming

| Component-Based Programming                                           | Object-Oriented Programming                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development focused on modules, blocks, or components                 | Development focused on objects                                               |
| Interchangeable code modules that work independently.                 | Developments depend on the parent objects and inherit their functionalities. |
| Doesn't require you to be familiar with components' inner workings    | Need to know inherited methods, data types, and behaviors of the parent object. |
| Involved with Rapid Application Development, saving time and money.   | Need to define and use objects from the ground up, which will take considerable time compared to using components. |
| Ideal for large-scale systems requiring high modularity, reusability, and flexibility in component deployment and updating. | Well-suited for applications where complex hierarchies and relationships exist. |
